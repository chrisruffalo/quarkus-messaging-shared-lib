# Quarkus Shared Library

## Bottom Line
This is a lot more rational but ties you a lot closer to Quarkus

### Pros:
- Testing is familiar and easy, just adding Quarkus bits
- You can run this in dev mode if you want and add dev-mode only services to do in-place/faster development

### Cons:
- Introduces a dependency on Quarkus which may not matter if you don't use other smallrye services
